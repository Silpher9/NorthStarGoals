# NorthStarGoals Cursor Rules

## 🚨 REQUIRED PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST

Before creating ANY git commit, automatically check and follow this:

- Is this a 🐛 :fix: commit? → Run `npm version patch --no-git-tag-version` FIRST
- Is this a ✨ :feat: commit? → Run `npm version minor --no-git-tag-version` FIRST
- Is this a breaking change? → Run `npm version major --no-git-tag-version` FIRST
- Is it 📝 :docs:, 🎨 :style:, ♻️ :refactor:, or ✅ :test:? → No version bump needed

**The version bump MUST be included in the same commit as the code changes.**

**DO THIS AUTOMATICALLY - DO NOT ASK THE USER TO DO IT.**

---

## Commit message format & Versioning

Commit subjects must start with an emoji + type:

- 🐛 :fix: ... ⚠️ **MUST bump PATCH version** (e.g. 1.1.0 → 1.1.1)
- ✨ :feat: ... ⚠️ **MUST bump MINOR version** (e.g. 1.1.0 → 1.2.0)
- 📝 :docs: ... (no version bump)
- 🎨 :style: ... (no version bump)
- ♻️ :refactor: ... (no version bump)
- 🚀 :perf: ... (no version bump unless it changes behavior)
- ✅ :test: ... (no version bump)

### Breaking Changes

Any breaking change (indicated by `!` in the type like `:feat!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE` footer) **MUST bump MAJOR version** (e.g. 1.1.0 → 2.0.0)

---

## Versioning Workflow (SemVer)

The app version is stored in `package.json` as `version` (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) and is displayed in the UI.

### MANDATORY REQUIREMENT - NO EXCEPTIONS

When creating a commit with :fix: or :feat:, you MUST automatically bump the package.json version using npm commands BEFORE making the commit. The version bump and code changes go in the SAME commit.

### Commands to use:

# For :fix: commits
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version

# For :feat: commits
npm version minor --no-git-tag-version

# For breaking changes
npm version major --no-git-tag-version


Workflow:

1. FIRST: Run the appropriate npm version command above

2. THEN: Stage the updated package.json along with your code changes

3. FINALLY: Create the commit with both changes together

⚠️ DO NOT create :fix: or :feat: commits without bumping the version first!
